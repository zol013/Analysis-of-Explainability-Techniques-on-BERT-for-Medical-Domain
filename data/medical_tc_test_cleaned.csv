non-cardiovascular,mechanism glucoregulatory responses stress and their deficiency diabetes during exercise increased energy demands met by increased glucose production that occurs simultaneously with increased glucose uptake we had previously observed that during exercise metabolic clearance rate glucose mcr increases markedly normal but only marginally poorly controlled diabetic dogs we wished determine i whether more general model stress matched increases rate appearance glucose and mcr also occur or if mcr suppressed as during catecholamine infusion and ii whether diabetes affects stressinduced changes rate glucose appearance and mcr therefore we injected carbachol 27 nmol50 microliters analog acetylcholine intracerebroventricularly seven conscious dogs before and after induction alloxan diabetes normal dogs plasma epinephrine and cortisol increased 4 5fold whereas norepinephrine and glucagon doubled plasma insulin however remained unchanged tracerdetermined hepatic glucose production increased rapidly but transiently by 25fold this increment can be fully explained by observed increments counterregulatory hormones surprisingly however mcr also promptly increased and therefore plasma glucose changed only marginally after induction diabetes animals given intracerebroventricular carbachol while plasma glucose maintained at moderate hyperglycemia 90 04 mm increments counterregulatory hormones similar those seen normal dogs except exaggerated norepinephrine release peripheral insulin levels higher diabetic than normal dogs however mcr markedly reduced and lipolytic response stress increased indicating insulin resistance interestingly hyperglycemic response stress 6fold greater diabetic than normal animals relating mainly failure mcr rise plasma lactate increased equivalently diabetic and normal animals despite suppression mcr diabetics indicating either greater muscle glycogenolysis andor impairment glucose oxidation we conclude that this stress model mcr increases as exercise normal but not diabetic dogs we speculate that glucose uptake stress could be mediated through insulindependent neural mechanism

non-cardiovascular,driving parkinsons disease altered motor or mental skills parkinsons disease pd could adversely affect driving ability we interviewed 150 patients regarding their driving habits and compared them with 100 controls thirty patients had stopped driving because pd pd patients had no more lifetime accidents than controls with increased disability however there smaller percentage patients still driving with fewer miles traveled and with proportionately more accidents occurring though disability scores did not correlate well with driving ability there significantly more accidents subjects with more severe pd presence cognitive impairment associated with increased accident rate we conclude that driving pd may be public health problem and that some pd patients should not drive
